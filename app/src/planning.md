Size & Shape
diameter: 939.4 km
What it means: Average width across Ceres

Everyday comparison:

About the distance from New York City to Chicago

Texas is ~1,270 km wide (Ceres is about 75% of Texas' width)

France is ~1,000 km across (Ceres would almost fit inside France)

Pluto is 2,377 km (Ceres is about 40% of Pluto's size)

extent: "964.4 × 964.2 × 891.8"
What it means: Ceres isn't a perfect sphere

Visualize: Imagine a ball slightly squished at the poles

Equator: ~964 km across (east-west and north-south at the middle)

Pole-to-pole: ~892 km (top to bottom)

Why? Spinning makes it bulge at the middle, like Earth

diameter_sigma: 0.2 km
What it means: "We're pretty sure about the size"

Translation: The measurement uncertainty is only 200 meters

Perspective: If Ceres were Earth-sized, this uncertainty would be like being unsure by just 2.7 km

Surface & Appearance
albedo: 0.09
What it means: How reflective Ceres is

Scale: 0 = black (absorbs all light), 1 = mirror (reflects all light)

Comparison:

Ceres (0.09): Like charcoal or fresh asphalt

Moon (0.12): Slightly brighter than Ceres

Earth (0.30): Much brighter

Venus (0.75): Very bright

Bottom line: Ceres is dark - it absorbs 91% of sunlight that hits it

BV: 0.713 & UB: 0.426
What it means: Ceres' color

Simple explanation: Astronomers measure brightness through different colored filters

B = Blue filter

V = Visual (yellow-green, what our eyes see best)

U = Ultraviolet filter

What the numbers mean:

BV = 0.713: Ceres is slightly redder than the Sun (Sun's BV = 0.66)

UB = 0.426: Ceres reflects less ultraviolet light compared to blue

Translation: Ceres looks dark gray with a slightly reddish tint

Rotation & Brightness
rot_per: 9.07417 hours
What it means: A "day" on Ceres

Everyday comparison:

Earth day: 24 hours

Ceres day: 9 hours, 4 minutes, 27 seconds

Mars day: 24.6 hours (similar to Earth)

Effect: The Sun rises and sets about 2.6 times faster on Ceres than on Earth

H: 3.34 (Absolute Magnitude)
What it means: How bright Ceres would look if it were 1 AU from both Earth and Sun

Scale: Lower number = brighter (like golf scores)

Comparison:

Sun: H = -26.7 (extremely bright)

Full Moon: H = -12.7

Venus at brightest: H = -4.9

Ceres at 1 AU: H = 3.34 (just barely visible to naked eye in perfect darkness)

Pluto: H = -1.0 (brighter than Ceres at same distance)

Reality: Ceres is never that close, so it's much fainter in our sky

Composition & Type
spec: "C" (C-type)
What it means: Ceres is a carbonaceous asteroid

Composition: Contains carbon, clay, hydrated minerals

Properties:

Dark surface (low albedo)

Contains water ice (Ceres has a subsurface ocean!)

Primitive material - similar to early solar system

Commonality: ~75% of asteroids are C-type

G and spec_T: "G"
What it means: A special subclass of C-type with evidence of water alteration

Key feature: Shows signs of water in its minerals

Why important: Confirms Ceres isn't just dry rock - it has water history

Mass & Gravity
GM: 62.873 km³/s²
What it means: Strength of Ceres' gravity

Breakdown:

G = gravitational constant

M = mass of Ceres

GM together = how strongly Ceres pulls on things

Gravity comparison:

Earth: 398,600 km³/s² (Ceres is 6,340 times weaker!)

Moon: 4,900 km³/s² (Ceres is 78 times weaker)

Ceres: 62.873 km³/s²

Surface gravity: About 2.8% of Earth's gravity

You would weigh: 150 lbs on Earth → 4.2 lbs on Ceres

You could jump over a 10-story building with a good leap!
